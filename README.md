Things that I used when hunting 

`gf-patterns`, personal patterns to hunt link and api-keys, link pattern is a giant regex and api-keys has each line explained.

`lists`

- `atldns`, contains a custom generated list for subdomain mutation, you will find scary stuff is using this one correctly

`fuzz`, some lists that are useful for fuzzing, custom backups filenames and common api endpoint, this custom api list is not from commonspeak

`params`, a copy of arjun params.txt file
